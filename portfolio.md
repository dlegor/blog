Portfolio

* Jul 2017 - Sep 2017 ,Inbursa Insurance/ Project Leader: Lev Guzman
Developed models for detection of traffic accident and classification of accidents to
improve the performance of insurance policies of the insurer. Developed a POC to
analyze information of the insure and the test of the implementation of the
classification and clustering models in its cluster (Big Data Technologies).
Work done together with the team of Complex Systems Lab UPIITA.

* Nov 2017 - Feb 2018 ,Indra Qro / Engineer Lead: Israel Magaña
Developed codes for processing and classification of posts from different social
media sources. The prototype of the code was made in python and the final code in
Scala-SparkML. Designed a Dashboard for the visualization of the results of the
classification massages or posts.

* Nov 2017 - Jan 2018 ,Root Technologies / Engineer Lead: Fabiola Rodriguez
Developed codes for processing data in distribution systems ( Spark) and
implementated models of anomalies detection in transations. The prototypes and
codes was made in python and the final code in Scala-Spark to production. In
addition, this project was to test the best practice to that business-cases and as part
of a project to system of detection of fraud.

* Mar 2018 - May 2018, Lavore Mexico / Project Manager: Yadir Cuevas
Developed a POC to analyze information, processing and implementation the best
practices to collection information. Developed codes in Python and I made a model
for segmentation the target population. Dashboard design in Bokeh – Python to
show you the results of the segmentation and other scopes of your data.

* Jul 2018 - Sep 2018, Indra Qro / Engineer Lead: Israel Magaña
Developed a POC to analyze , process and make model with customer data of a
business segment of Santander Bank. The objective was to detect the duplicity of
the client from different characteristics with machine learning models and deep
learning, to be exact with NLP and dimensionality reduction techniques with Neural
Network. Developed codes in Python.

* Jan 2019 - Feb 2019, Indra Qro / Engineer Lead: Israel Magaña
Designed the architecture and developed the POC for an OCR system to process
bank checks. The system contained 3 main algorithms: handwritten detections, text
in image translated into text, detection of forms and characteristics of signatures.
The system was designed to be scalable and extensible, in other words, several
results could be entered into other business cases.

* Mar 2019, Lavore Mexico / Project Manager: Yadir Cuevas
Collaborated in the design and data architecture in the Lavore / Envolve Fintech
application for the distribution of payments. I helped with the supervision of the
required technologies and resources, also with advice on best practices for the
2development and deployment of models on different platforms (AWS and Google
Cloud).

* March 2019 - August 2019, Ixulabs - Project Manager: Fernanda Monjaraz
● Collaborated in the design and development of chatbots systems,
implementing NLP and NLU models and processing audio signals to text. The
chatbots were designed to carry out conversations, as well as to perform
operational tasks of the company. Developed codes in Python.
● Collaborated in the design and development of OCR systems, implementing
multiple techniques from openCV, C ++, Shell, PDF extractors, etc. Codes
developed in Python, Shell and C ++.
● Develop a component to perform semantic searches in different text
sources and pdf files, to analyze word sets.
